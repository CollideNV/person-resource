## Architecture Update: Single Java Package

We've simplified our project architecture to use a single Java package. Given that our codebase only contains 4 classes, the previous package structure was overkill. This change helps reduce unnecessary complexity and keeps things streamlined and easier to maintain.

If our class count grows significantly in the future, we can reconsider and adjust the package structure accordingly.
